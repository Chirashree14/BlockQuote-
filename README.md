# 🧱 BlockQuote – A Decentralized Quote Storage Smart Contract  

## 📜 Project Description  
**BlockQuote** is a simple and elegant Ethereum smart contract built with Solidity.  
It allows users to store, manage, and retrieve their favorite quotes directly on the blockchain — making them permanent, verifiable, and censorship-resistant.  

Whether you want to create an on-chain collection of motivational quotes or a decentralized “Quote of the Day” dApp, **BlockQuote** provides the perfect foundation.  

---

## 💡 What It Does  
- Stores quotes with their text, author, and the exact timestamp when added.  
- Anyone can submit a new quote using the `addQuote()` function.  
- Users can retrieve quotes by ID using the `getQuote()` function.  
- Emits an event `QuoteAdded` every time a new quote is stored — perfect for dApp front-end integration.  
- Keeps track of the total number of quotes ever added.  

---

## ✨ Features  
- **Decentralized:** Quotes are stored permanently on-chain.  
- **Timestamped:** Each quote includes the time it was created.  
- **Transparent:** All additions trigger an on-chain event (`QuoteAdded`).  
- **User-friendly:** Simple functions for adding and retrieving quotes.  
- **Upgradeable:** Easy to extend for pagination, ownership control, or IPFS integration.
